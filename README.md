## üìå Problem Statement

**Problem Statement 12 ‚Äì Revolutionizing Educational Assessment**

---

## üéØ Objective

Evalo solves the tedious and time-consuming process of evaluating student exam papers, particularly those with handwritten mathematical expressions, complex diagrams, and challenging handwriting styles. It serves educators at all levels who need to grade papers efficiently while providing meaningful feedback to students.

Our platform automates the evaluation process, allowing teachers to focus on teaching rather than grading while ensuring consistent assessment quality.

## üß† Team & Approach

### Team Name:  
`EvaloBrains`

### Team Members:  
- Riswan Muhammed M S ([GitHub](https://github.com/rixprog) / Full Stack Developer)
- Surya Narayanana K V ([GitHub](https://github.com/suryanarayanankv) / AI Integration Specialist)

### Your Approach:  
- We chose this problem because grading papers is one of the most time-consuming tasks for educators, leaving less time for actual teaching and curriculum development
- Key challenges we addressed include:
  - Accurately interpreting diverse handwriting styles
  - Evaluating complex mathematical expressions without errors
  - Understanding and assessing student-drawn diagrams and illustrations
  - Creating meaningful, contextual feedback based on student answers
- Our breakthrough moment came when we successfully integrated Groq's API to dramatically speed up the evaluation process while maintaining high accuracy

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### Core Technologies Used:
- Frontend: React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: FastAPI (Python)
- Database: Firebase
- APIs: Groq API 
- Hosting: Netlify (Frontend), Render (Backend)

### Sponsor Technologies Used (if any):
- ‚úÖ **Groq:** _Groq's lightning-fast API forms the backbone of our evaluation engine, delivering results in seconds rather than minutes. Its superior natural language understanding enabled us to accurately interpret complex mathematical expressions and technical content in handwritten form. Without Groq's exceptional speed and precision, Evalo's core functionality would be significantly compromised‚Äîthe API's performance was truly transformative for our project's success._
